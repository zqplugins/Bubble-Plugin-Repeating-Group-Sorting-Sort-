    "plugin_instructions": "1 - Make sure all the rows in your repeating group that you want to sort are visible on the page. Pagination is not supported.\n\n2 - Give your repeating group and the element that contains the value (e.g. text element) you want to sort on an ID attribute.\n\nYou can find the ID attribute field at the bottom of the 'Appearance' properties of an element. See the demo page for more context.\n\nIf you do not have ID attribute enabled, you can enable it in your Bubble application by going to the 'Settings' tab and go to 'General'. Next, scroll all the way down and under 'Advanced options' you find the option to enable 'Expose the option to add an ID attribute to HTML elements'.\n\n3 - Use one of the 3 sorting workflow actions (number, date or text) to sort your repeating group!",
